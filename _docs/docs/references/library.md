## Notes

Calling the `Library` object will immediately start retrieving all tracks and playlists from the XML file passed as a parameter.

To date, there is 1 known problem preventing the library from loading correctly:

* A tag's value must be consistent with its type. Tags registered as "integer" inside the XML file (such as BPM, Track Number, Disc Count, etc.) must be filled with integers only.
